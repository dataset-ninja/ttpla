**TTPLA: An Aerial-Image Dataset for Detection and Segmentation of Transmission Towers and Power Lines** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 1242 images with 11468 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *cable*, *tower_lattice*, *tower_wooden*, and other: *tower_tucohy* and *void*.

Each image in the TTPLA dataset has bounding boxes annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (1242 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 5 classes:
