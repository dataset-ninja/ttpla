**TTPLA: An Aerial-Image Dataset for Detection and Segmentation of Transmission Towers and Power Lines** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1234 images with 11447 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *cable*, *tower_lattice*, *tower_wooden*, and other: *tower_tucohy* and *void*. There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (905 images), *test* (220 images), and *val* (109 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the University of South Carolina.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
