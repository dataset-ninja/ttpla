In the pursuit of accurate transmission tower (TT) and power line (PL) detection and segmentation in aerial images, the authors of the dataset have introduced a novel dataset named TT/PL Aerial-image (TTPLA) dataset. This dataset addresses challenges related to the detection and segmentation of TTs and PLs, such as their elongated and thin shapes, color similarities to the background, and variations in object shape and scene characteristics. The TTPLA dataset comprises 1,100 aerial images, each with a resolution of 3,840 Ã— 2,160 pixels. Additionally, the dataset offers manual annotations for 8,987 instances of TTs and PLs. Unlike other datasets, TTPLA supports not only detection and semantic segmentation but also instance segmentation, providing a comprehensive evaluation platform for computer vision models.

The dataset's aerial images were extracted from UAV-taken videos and encompass various recording characteristics. To ensure comprehensive coverage, different view angles were captured, including front view, top view, and side view of TTs. This diverse approach aids in training deep learning models to recognize TTs from any perspective. The dataset also considers variations in zooming levels during image capture to accurately represent PLs, particularly in the presence of noisy backgrounds. Various time of day and weather conditions were considered when recording videos, contributing to the dataset's realism. Backgrounds were given special attention to accurately capture PLs, as the UAV's viewpoint often results in noisy backgrounds. The dataset reflects this reality by containing PL images with challenging backgrounds, resembling real-world conditions where PLs may exhibit "thin and long" features and blend into the surroundings.

For accurate instance-level labeling of TTs and PLs, the authors employed LabelME. Expert annotators meticulously outlined each instance with polygons. The annotations were consistent across annotators due to the dataset's top-view orientation, minimal occlusions, clear labeling policies, and the high scrutiny applied by the three expert annotators. The authors provided annotated samples within the TTPLA dataset to showcase the quality of annotations and the dataset's utility.

Overall, the authors' TT/PL Aerial-image (TTPLA) dataset presents a valuable resource for advancing the field of object detection and segmentation, especially in the context of transmission towers and power lines within aerial images.
